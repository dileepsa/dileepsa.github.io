Nandi Hills, a small albeit beautiful town, is just 60 km away from the city of Bangalore and has emerged as the perfect weekend getaway for its people. Even though it is most well-known for its viewpoints and its greenery, Nandi Hills is also a popular historical fortress that is home to a number of temples, monuments and shrines.

## How to reach

The best way to reach the Nandi Hills is by taking a personal vehicle if you have limited time or seek comfort. Alternatively, you can choose KSRTC buses from the bus stand and reach Nandi Hills within 2-3 hours from Bangalore city centre.

You can also head out to Chikballapur, which lies at a distance of 10 KM from Nandi Hills and to cover the remaining distance, you can opt for an auto ride.

A visit to Tipu’s Drop is bound to leave you with goosebumps. It is a steep rock that is located 600m above sea level. However, apart from the view and the climb, what is most remarkable about this cliff is that it was used by Tipu Sultan to punish his prisoners by tossing them from the top of the hill. Even though this place is safely fortified with fences and barricades now, it remains an intriguing attraction.

## Nandi Hills Park
