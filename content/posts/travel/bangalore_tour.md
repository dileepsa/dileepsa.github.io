## Iskon Temple

ISKCON Temple is known for its activities of engagement involving ardent devotees of Lord Krishna.

The architecture of Bangalore's ISKCON temple is a magnificent presence and is credited to being the largest ISKCON complexes in the world. 

The most distinctive feature of this temple is it's gold plated flag post which stands at a height of 17 metres.

The main shrine which is also called the Rajagopuram has beautiful archways and water fountains.


## Ragigudda Anjaneya Temple

The history behind the name of the temple is as fantasizing as Hanuman Leelas. It is believed that a big heap of Ragi (a food grain) turned out to become a stone, hence the name “Ragigudda”.


The temple is on top of a big rock. The experience that we get while climbing to this temple is unique. The view from the top of the temple is a eyefeast.
