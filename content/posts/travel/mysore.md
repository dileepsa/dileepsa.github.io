Chamundi Hill Temple is a Hindu temple located in Mysore. It is one of the major places of pilgrimage in Karnataka.

The Chamundi Temple is dedicated to Goddess Chamundeswari, an incarnation of Goddess Parvathi who took this form to destroy Mahishasura. This is one of the top places to visit in Mysore. Also known as Krouncha Pitham, Chamundi Temple is one among the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas representing the hair of Sati Devi.

A God gifted piece of land on the bank of Kaveri is Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary.

When at the Sanctuary, you must go for a boat ride at the river and the islets as guided boat trips are the best facilities available at the sanctuary. The boat ride offers you not just with a breath-taking scenic beauty but also with glimpses of a wide variety of beautiful birds as well.

The palace you see today was actually built in 1912 after a fire destroyed the first palace and it is a beautiful example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, a fusion of styles that creates a really spectacular sight.
