## What are these ?

Coding standards set the rules and guidelines that enable your team to create more efficient code that's easier to read, analyze, maintain, and extend.

## Why should I learn these ?

These principles are a set of guidelines that help you write better, robust, and clean code. Once, you start applying them, you’ll start seeing the results on the overall process of developing products.

## KISS

According to the keep it simple, stupid principle the key to building a successful product is simplicity. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Code should be easy to read and understand without much thinking. If it isn't then there is a prospect of simplification.

### Advantages

- Less time to write
- Less chances of bugs
- Easier to understand, debug and modify

`Note: `
KISS is also used as an acronym for keep it short and simple, keep it short and sweet, and keep it simple and straightforward. However, all these variations refer to the same approach 

## DRY
![DRY](/images/codingPrinciples/dry.jpeg)

Don’t’ Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a very common acronym used by programmers to denote that software programs are created to automate certain repetitive tasks that humans do not wish to waste time and energy. Duplication of code can make code very difficult to maintain. Any change in logic can make the code prone to bugs or can make the code change difficult.

### Advantages

- Maintainability
- Readability
- Code reusability
- Reduced errors

## YAGNI

In simple terms, YAGNI as a principle means the removal of unnecessary functionality or logic. Often programmers have a tendency of over-seeing the future and overloading the program with unnecessary logic, algorithms, methods, and codes which will never be used. 

### Advantages

- Better developer performance
- More flexible codebase

## Separation of Concerns

The idea of separation of concerns states that a program should be designed with different containers, and these containers should not have access to each other. A classic example of this method is MVC. For example, the code that handles the database doesn't need to know how to render the data in the browser.

### Advantages
 - It improves modularity
 - Enhances Maintainability
 - Increases Reusability
 - Better testability
 - Makes it easy to understand

## Single Responsibility

The single responsibility principle states that every class or module in a program should only provide one specific functionality.

### Advantages
- Reduced Coupling
- Makes it easier to debug
- Promotes Readability

## Wrapping up

Developers can improve code reusability, modularity, and flexibility by adhering to these principles, resulting in more scalable and robust software solutions. Good programmers and properly readable code go really well with each other.
