## First solo trip

As this is my first solo trip. I am so excited to explore and roam around. I chose to explore Tamilnadu's historic temples. I wanted a break in my busy life. Let's start seeing tamil nadu from my eyes...

## Places I have visited

### Tirupati

Starting with tirupati. I have been to tiruapti many from my childhood. But this time i felt something different. I never forget the morning walk in the semi-crowded street where you will be blessed with a pleasant cool breeze. The chanting of “Om Namo Venkateshaya” mantra reverberates the entire Tirumala.

### Vellore

Coming to vellore. The Vellore Golden Temple complex is spread across a large area of 100 acres and looks picturesque with some small but green hill ranges forming its backdrop. The specialty of the Golden Temple is that it is true to its name. The temple is as exquisite and fabulous, as it is unique and awe-inspiring. The temple complex also consists of a star-shaped pathway that one must cover to approach the main shrine and absorbs a lot of positive energy from nature.

### Arunachalam(Tiruvanamalai)

After a pleasant view of golden temple. Started to Arunachalam. Being one of the Pancha Bhoota Stalams [5 sacred temples] which represents the five basic elements of life. Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Sky, the Arunachaleswara Temple is one of the most sacred Shaivite temple which represents the element Fire.  Here, Lord Shiva is said to have manifested himself as a massive column of fire, whose beginning and end could not be found by Brahma and Vishnu. Performing ‘Girivalam’ or circumambulation every full moon day is considered an auspicious spiritual activity, carried on a 14 kilometres long path. 

### Kanchipuram
