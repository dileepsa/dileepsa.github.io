## Overview

Coorg is located on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats in Karnataka. With year-round pleasant weather, lush coffee estates and thick forests, it is one of the most sought-after hill destinations in India.

## Day 1
### Golden Temple

Namdroling Monastery should be high up in your list of places to visit in Coorg. It is home to thousands of students (both monks and nuns) from the Tibetan community that live and study in these premises.

The monastery has many buildings and as a tourist, you must take care of not disturbing the monks going about their daily prayers or rituals. The main chamber is gigantic with three huge statues of Tibetan deities in gold color.

### Dubare Elephant Camp

Dubare elephant camp in Coorg is a project undertaken by the forest department. The camp provides food and shelter to retired elephants after they work in the logging business. It is fairly ethical and the elephants are treated well, much like a pet companion.

It is present in the banks of cauvery river. We need to cross the cauvery river to reach the elephant camp. You can also feed the elephants ragi, jaggery, and sugarcane while you are there.

### Chikhole reservoir

Gather inner peace and seclusion to your trip with this pristine reservoir located in between Madikeri and Kushalnagar in Coorg district.

It is not that good when the water is not there in reserviour.

## Day 2

### Abbey falls

The falls are gorgeous during the monsoon when waterfed. These falls are not that much impressive when water is not there.

### Mandalpatti view

Mandalpatti mountain is trekking route near Madikeri just 4 km from Abbey Falls. The route is extremely scenic with aerial views of lush green mountains of the Pushpagiri reserve forest area. While you can ride to most of the area, you will have to trek the last 3 km. The jungle is moderately dense and the ride is best experienced on a jeep. 

There is no public transport that travels to this point. Book a private vehicle for the trip. You must carry plenty of water and some food for the trip since there aren’t many stopovers.

### Madikeri fort

Madikeri Fort is one of the last remnants of the Haleri dynasty in Coorg. I will not say that the fort is in the best of its conditions. You can see a considerable amount of degradation.

### Raja's seat

Raja’s seat is probably the most important tourist attraction inside Madikeri town. It is famous for its sunset spot. The gardens are maintained flawlessly to date.
