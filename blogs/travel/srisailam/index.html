<p>The second jyotirling of Shiva , named Mallikarjuna Swamy is located in Srisailam, Andhra Pradesh, also termed as Kashi of the South. It is located at a distance of around 268 kms from Vijayawada in Nallamala hill forests along the banks of Krishna river. The important attractions in the area include the Panchamathams, Sakshi Ganapathi, Sikharam and Srisilam Dam. The best time to visit Srisailam is the monsoon season when the forests are green offering spectacular views.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-reach">How to reach</h2>
<p>The better travel option to srisailam from vijayawada is bus if you are travelling with friends.
The vehicles will be halted from 10pm - 6am at Dornala as it a forest area.</p>
<p>We travelled via bus which is a good experience.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-stay">Where to Stay</h2>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/stay.jpeg" alt="Stay"></p>
<p>As there are many satrams around or in srisailam. It&rsquo;s purely cast based which is the one things i never liked about srisailam. As they allow only families but not bachelors.</p>
<p>We booked a room for 4 people which costs around 1000 per day.</p>
<h2 id="mallikarjuna-temple">Mallikarjuna Temple</h2>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/mallikarjun_temple.jpeg" alt="mallikarjun_temple"></p>
<p>It is quite obvious that your trip to Srisailam canâ€™t be complete without a visit to Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga Temple. This popular site is also called Shakti Peetha as is frequented by believers and devotees throughout the year. The temple that is dedicated to Lord Shiva and his wife Parvati has an aura that reverberates with reverence. While you are in this divine location, do take part in the religious activities to get spiritual peace and tranquility.</p>
<h2 id="pathala-ganga">Pathala Ganga</h2>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/pathala_ganga.webp" alt="pathala_ganga"></p>
<p>As the River Krishna turns down hill, it is surrounded by a certain spirituality in the air. Enjoy the sceneries around you and take a dip into these sacred waters, believed to have medicinal properties for healing skin diseases.</p>
<p>One can also try the enjoyable ropeway car ride and look down at the majestic river and lush green beauty all around.</p>
<h2 id="srisailam-dam">Srisailam Dam</h2>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/boat_riding.jpeg" alt="boat_riding"></p>
<p>The Srisailam Dam is a manmade marvel that has become one of the main tourist attractions of the area. Surrounded by beautiful nature all around, the dam offers wonderful views during monsoon season when all the gates are open. The excellent greenery all around, the sound of the water gushing through and the rhythmic fall of water makes it a heaven for nature lovers.</p>
<h2 id="chenchu-lakshmi-tribal-museum">Chenchu Lakshmi Tribal Museum</h2>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/temple_selfie.jpeg" alt="temple_selfie"></p>
<p>Find yourself fascinated as you witness instances of the livelihoods and cultures of the tribes of Andhra Pradesh at the Chenchu Lakshmi Museum. Also, honey collected by the tribes and packaged by the state government is also available at the museum for sale and is a true specialty to take back home.</p>
<h1 id="rudra-vanam-park">Rudra vanam park</h1>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/shiv_linga.jpeg" alt="shiv_linga"></p>
<p>Once you are in Srisailam, this park offers you a peaceful time to walk around. Not an adventurous place. Ideal for family picnic time. Its neatly maintained, so you can get young kids too.
Nothing much to do, apart from some view points to see the river and valley.</p>
<h1 id="sree-shivaji-spoorthy-kendram">Sree shivaji spoorthy kendram</h1>
<p><img src="/images/srisailam/shivaji.jpeg" alt="shivaji">
You&rsquo;ll wonder what a memorial of Shivaji is doing in the midst of Srisailam town. This unique tinge-pinkish memorial is dedicate to King Shivaji. You&rsquo;ll learn a lot about this great kingdom through paintings.</p>
