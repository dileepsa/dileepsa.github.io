Gauge is comparable with Protractor or JUnit extended with Cucumber (if you haven’t heard of these, they are worth checking out).\n' +

      '- Running the specs\n' +
      '- Hooks\n' +
      '- Reports\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Setup \n' +
      '\n' +
      'To start a new project, create a new folder and run ```gauge init python``` in it. This will setup a basic Gauge project.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Gauge supports a total of 5 languges that are c#, java, javascript, python, ruby. Gauge has very good support of vs code. Install the gauge plugin for vs code.\n' +

      '### WRITING THE SPECS\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The specs are written in Markdown. Each spec file starts with a title . Next, some steps can be defined that will be run before each scenario. When listing steps, you need to prefix each step with an asterix (*) as in a Markdown list. After that, the actual scenarios can be written. They start with a title . Again, the steps for a scenario should be listed as in a Markdown list. You can also add some tags which can be used to only run certain specs and to search in the HTML reports. Here’s an example specification:\n' +

It doesn’t matter in which file you put the functions, you’re free to choose how to organize them. As long as they are under the step_impl folder.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### RUNNING THE SPECS\n' +

After running the specs, a nice HTML report will be outputted to the /reports folder. It shows which tests succeeded and which failed with some additional graphs. In the report you’ll even find how long it took to run a test and each of its steps. There’s also a search functionality to quickly find a certain spec.\n' +

      '![Playwright logo](/images/playwright/logo.webp)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Playwright was created specifically to accommodate the needs of end-to-end testing. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed with native mobile emulation. Built by the Microsoft team.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Not only is it versatile and easy to work with, but it has lightning-fast execution speeds and some great features that are unique to the Playwright framework, such as Trace Viewer and Test Generator.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- **Test Generator** : is a browser tool that Playwright provides, which records the actions performed in the browser and generates the equivalent code. This is useful if you want to quickly draft some tests or upskill members of your team who are not so familiar with writing code.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Why use the Playwright framework?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It’s an open-source framework relatively new to the market but is building up popularity fast. Microsoft maintains it and, as a result, receives regular updates and improvements. If we look at the number of downloads for similar frameworks which have been on the market for a while, you can see Playwright has burst onto the scene.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Key features of Playwright\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Here are a few of the key features of Playwright**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- Support for cross-browser platforms built on Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox – which includes Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- Support for cross-platform execution on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- Support for cross-language, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET – write tests in the environment that suits you while still covering all areas and formats.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- Built with modern architecture and no restrictions – interact with multi-page, multi-tab websites like a real user, and tackle frames and browser events with ease.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## Architecture\n' +
      '\n' +
      'So a good way to understand this is to compare it with Selenium – Selenium sends each command as a separate HTTP request and receives JSON responses. So every interaction, such as opening the browser, clicking an element, or sending keys in Selenium, is sent as a separate HTTP request.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As you can imagine, this results in slower execution as we wait for responses and introduces a layer of potential flakiness.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Playwright, on the other hand, communicates all requests through a single WebSocket connection, which stays in place until test execution is completed. This reduces the points of failure and allows commands to be sent quickly on a single connection.\n' +
      '\n' +

      'Playwright works on three core concepts: browser, context, and page.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '- **Browser**: To run the tests, you must initiate the browser. Using Playwright, you can use the object of the Browser   class,  an instance of Chromium, Firefox, or Webkit.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications. Real-time web functionality is the ability to have server code push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available, rather than having the server wait for a client to request new data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'SignalR provides a simple API for creating server-to-client remote procedure calls (RPC) that call JavaScript functions in client browsers (and other client platforms) from server-side .NET code. SignalR also includes API for connection management (for instance, connect and disconnect events), and grouping connections.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The simple RPC is explained in below image:\n' +
      '![Communication](/images/signalr/signalr_communication.webp)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'SignalR supports "server push" functionality, in which server code can call out to client code in the browser using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), rather than the request-response model common on the web today.\n' +

      'Currently, I am using signalR client using signalrcore module.\n' +

      '## Hubs\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A Hub is a more high-level pipeline built upon the Connection API that allows your client and server to call methods on each other directly. SignalR handles the dispatching across machine boundaries as if by magic, allowing clients to call methods on the server as easily as local methods, and vice versa.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## How Hubs work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When server-side code calls a method on the client, a packet is sent across the active transport that contains the name and parameters of the method to be called (when an object is sent as a method parameter, it is serialized using JSON). The client then matches the method name to methods defined in client-side code. If there is a match, the client method will be executed using the deserialized parameter data.\n' +
