  <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>After tiring and prolonged work schedule for many weeks, we decided to head towards a place where we could score a completely new experience. We wanted a bike trip along with the experience. So we dediced to explore lepakshi.</p>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/lepakshi_temple.jpeg" alt="Lepakshi"></p>
<p>The name <code>Lepakshi</code> formed from the union of two Telugu words  <strong>Le &amp; Pakshi</strong> ‚Äì which means <strong>Rise &amp; Bird</strong> respectively. As per the Ramayana Mythology Ram helped Jatayu to attain Moksha by uttering these two words. Hence, the name is Lepakshi.</p>
<h2 id="hanging-pillar">Hanging pillar</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/hanging_pillar.webp" alt="Hanging pillar"></p>
<p>The mystery of hanging pillar of Lepakshi is that there is one pillar which grazes the ceiling and is actually hanging in air and not resting on grounds.</p>
<p>Call it the skill and engineering genius of the people who were expert in Vijayanagar style of architecture or an unsolved miracle, the hanging pillar of Lepakshi is one of the most famous in Lepakshi Village!</p>
<h2 id="lepakshi-nandhi">Lepakshi Nandhi</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/lepakshi_nandhi.webp" alt="Lepakshi Nandhi"></p>
<p>At 27ft in length and 15ft in height, it is a colossal structure, reputedly India‚Äôs biggest monolithic Nandi. Its grand size and the perfectly proportioned body make it a popular photo-op with visitors.</p>
<h2 id="jatayu">Jatayu</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/jatayu.webp" alt="Jatayu"></p>
<p>This large statue of the mythological bird Jatayu from the Ramayana is a major attraction. It is believed that Jatayu fell in here after being attacked by Ravan and ‚ÄúLe Pakshi‚Äù means ‚ÄúRise, bird‚Äù in Telugu.</p>
<h2 id="gudibande-lake-view-point">Gudibande lake view point</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/gudibande_lake.jpeg" alt="Gudibande lake"></p>
<p>Gudibande lake view point is around 3 km from gudibande fort. It was a perfect destination to see the fog in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="gudibande-fort">Gudibande Fort</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/gudibande_fort.jpeg" alt="Gudibande Fort"></p>
<p>The rocky terrain makes for a perfect climb up the hill, great for trekking enthusiasts to find joy in.</p>
<p>Once you reach the summit of the hill, you‚Äôll find a Shiva temple which is believed to be one of the oldest and one of the 108 Jyotirlingas. Witness the sculptures and take in the mesmerizing views from the top.</p>
<h2 id="infinity-pool">Infinity Pool</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/inifinity_pool.jpeg" alt="Infinity pool"></p>
<p>while coming back we halted at infinity pool for a photo shoot. Though it was a good place for a photo buffs. Here are some pictures</p>
<h2 id="food-street">Food Street</h2>
<p><img src="/images/lepakshi/food_street.webp" alt="Food Street"></p>
<p>After hitting the traffic in bangalore, we can&rsquo;t drive anymore, so we decided to eat something and here is the best place for people who are hungry enough.</p>
<p>Food street makes you hungry even after you eat enough. There are certain dishes we tried, the food was delicious</p>
<p>Here are some of the things we tried :</p>
<p><strong>Devanagere Butter Dosa :</strong>
<img src="/images/lepakshi/devanagere_dosa.webp" alt="Dosa"></p>
<p><strong>Spring Potato :</strong>
