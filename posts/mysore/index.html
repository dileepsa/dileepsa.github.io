<p>A God gifted piece of land on the bank of Kaveri is Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary.</p>
<p>When at the Sanctuary, you must go for a boat ride at the river and the islets as guided boat trips are the best facilities available at the sanctuary. The boat ride offers you not just with a breath-taking scenic beauty but also with glimpses of a wide variety of beautiful birds as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/mysore/mysore.jpeg" alt="Mysore palace"></p>

<p>Mysore Palace is the venue for the famous Mysore Dasara and it is often used to promote Mysore Tourism. It is surronded with large garden.</p>
<p>The palace you see today was actually built in 1912 after a fire destroyed the first palace and it is a beautiful example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, a fusion of styles that creates a really spectacular sight.</p>
<h2 id="ksr-dam">KSR Dam</h2>
<p><img src="/images/mysore/ksr_dam.jpeg" alt="ksr dam"></p>
