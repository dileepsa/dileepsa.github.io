<p>Nandi Hills, a small albeit beautiful town, is just 60 km away from the city of Bangalore and has emerged as the perfect weekend getaway for its people. Even though it is most well-known for its viewpoints and its greenery, Nandi Hills is also a popular historical fortress that is home to a number of temples, monuments and shrines.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-reach">How to reach</h2>
<p>The best way to reach the Nandi Hills is by taking a personal vehicle if you have limited time or seek comfort. Alternatively, you can choose KSRTC buses from the bus stand and reach Nandi Hills within 2-3 hours from Bangalore city centre.</p>
<p>You can also head out to Chikballapur, which lies at a distance of 10 KM from Nandi Hills and to cover the remaining distance, you can opt for an auto ride.</p>
<p>We took a cab which costs around 2500 for 4 people.</p>

Hence, it is at all times advised to visit the hills either during the early morning hours or as soon as the sun sets in the evening.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-do-in-nandi-hills">Things to do in Nandi Hills</h2>
<p>Most from Bangalore go for the drive and early sunrise in Nandi Hills. But with its popularity, so has its tourism that promotes living close to nature. There are resorts with various activities like camping, trekking on other hills, paragliding, and cycling.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nandi_hills/bridge.jpeg" alt="Sunrise point"></p>
<p>The sunrise point is on the bridge. The bridge is crowded with people makes you feel scary. Even though it is crowded the view we get there is fantastic.</p>
<h2 id="bhoga-nandeeshwara-temple">Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple</h2>
<p><img src="/images/nandi_hills/temple.jpeg" alt="Temple"></p>
<p>The Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple is one of the oldest temples in the area. Despite its ancient stature, it is an example of fine craftsmanship and handicrafts.</p>
<p>The walls and interiors of the temple are decorated with incredible metalwork and stone carvings. The structure is supported by huge pillars and the temple itself is dedicated to Lord Shiva and his famous consorts- Nandi and Parvati.</p>
<h2 id="tippus-drop">Tippu&rsquo;s Drop</h2>
<p><img src="/images/nandi_hills/hill_top_2.jpeg" alt="Hill top"></p>
<p>A visit to Tipu’s Drop is bound to leave you with goosebumps. It is a steep rock that is located 600m above sea level. However, apart from the view and the climb, what is most remarkable about this cliff is that it was used by Tipu Sultan to punish his prisoners by tossing them from the top of the hill. Even though this place is safely fortified with fences and barricades now, it remains an intriguing attraction.</p>
<h2 id="nandi-hills-park">Nandi Hills Park</h2>
<p><img src="/images/nandi_hills/nandi_park.jpeg" alt="Nandi park"></p>
<p>This park’s right at the center with beautiful greenery. The morning vibes while walking through the park is absolutely worth the visit. Take your time and wander everywhere through it. However, look out for the signs that don’t allow you to walk over some spots.</p>
