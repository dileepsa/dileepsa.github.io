<p><img src="/images/shivgange/nandhi.jpg" alt="Nandhi"></p>
<p>Shivagange is a mountain peak with a height of 804.8 meters. The sacred mountain is shaped as a shivalinga and a spring flows near locally called &ldquo;Ganga&rdquo;, thereby by giving the place its name. It also famously known as <strong>Dakshina kashi</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-reach">How to reach</h2>
<p><img src="/images/shivgange/bike_trip.jpg" alt="Bikes"></p>
<p>There was a time in my life, during my bangalore days, where i went on regular bike trips. I went to shivgange with my friends in the early morning to not to miss the morning view. It&rsquo;s about 90kms away from bangalore.</p>
<h2 id="trek">Trek</h2>
<p><img src="/images/shivgange/selfie.jpg" alt="Trek"></p>
<p>The temple is a popular trekking site among the trekkers. The trail to the peak is well marked and has man-made steps.
The mountain peak provides a huge adrenalin rush to the adventure seekers. Monkeys are found in most of the places here. Be very careful with the monkeys. Do not mess with them!!!.</p>
<h2 id="hill-top">Hill top</h2>
<p><img src="/images/shivgange/top_selfie.jpg" alt="Hill Top"></p>
<p>There is a huge Nandi Statue at the top of the mountain. The path to the Nandi statue from olakal theertha is narrow and steep. There are railings that are provided but one definitely needs to be cautious while attempting to climb till the Nandi Statue.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My experience</h2>
<p><img src="/images/shivgange/shiv_parvathi.jpg" alt="Shiv parvathi"></p>
<p>After a tiring trek to the top of the hill. It&rsquo;s really worth doing this hard trek. The <strong>VIEW</strong> from the top is breathtaking. The panoramic view from the shiv temple is just awesome. The cool breeze and clouds around you make you feel chill. Slowly you can see the whole village from the clouds. Overall i felt it&rsquo;s one of those best views you get.</p>
