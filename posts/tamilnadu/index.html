  <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><h2 id="first-solo-trip">First solo trip</h2>
<p>As this is my first solo trip. I am so excited to explore and roam around. I chose to explore Tamilnadu&rsquo;s historic temples. I wanted a break in my busy life. Let&rsquo;s start seeing tamil nadu from my eyes&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="places-i-have-visited">Places I have visited</h2>
<h3 id="tirupati">Tirupati</h3>
<p>Starting with tirupati. I have been to tiruapti many from my childhood. But this time i felt something different. I never forget the morning walk in the semi-crowded street where you will be blessed with a pleasant cool breeze. The chanting of ‚ÄúOm Namo Venkateshaya‚Äù mantra reverberates the entire Tirumala.</p>
<h3 id="vellore">Vellore</h3>
<p><img src="/images/tamilnadu/vellore.jpg" alt="Vellore"></p>
<p>Coming to vellore. The Vellore Golden Temple complex is spread across a large area of 100 acres and looks picturesque with some small but green hill ranges forming its backdrop. The specialty of the Golden Temple is that it is true to its name. The temple is as exquisite and fabulous, as it is unique and awe-inspiring. The temple complex also consists of a star-shaped pathway that one must cover to approach the main shrine and absorbs a lot of positive energy from nature.</p>
<h3 id="arunachalamtiruvanamalai">Arunachalam(Tiruvanamalai)</h3>
<p><img src="/images/tamilnadu/arunachalam.jpg" alt="Arunachalam"></p>
<p>After a pleasant view of golden temple. Started to Arunachalam. Being one of the Pancha Bhoota Stalams [5 sacred temples] which represents the five basic elements of life. Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Sky, the Arunachaleswara Temple is one of the most sacred Shaivite temple which represents the element Fire.  Here, Lord Shiva is said to have manifested himself as a massive column of fire, whose beginning and end could not be found by Brahma and Vishnu. Performing ‚ÄòGirivalam‚Äô or circumambulation every full moon day is considered an auspicious spiritual activity, carried on a 14 kilometres long path.</p>
<h3 id="kanchipuram">Kanchipuram</h3>
<p><img src="/images/tamilnadu/kanchi_light.jpg" alt="Kanchipuram"></p>
<p>Kanchipuram is a city in northern Tamil Nadu, which is known popularly as temple city. It is known for its silk sarees, temples and history. I was wanting to visit this city for a long time. Kanchipuram is different, it is a city of temples and has way more than hundred temples. The main temple in kanchipuram is kamakshi amman temple. Kamakshi Amman Temple, devoted to the goddess Kamakshi. The temple‚Äôs major deity, Kamakshi, is depicted with four palms and is believed to be a manifestation of the goddess Parvati.</p>
<h3 id="mahabalipuram">Mahabalipuram</h3>
<p><img src="/images/tamilnadu/mahabalipuram.jpg" alt="Mahabalipuram"></p>
<p>India has a unique and diverse culture. Every Indian state has a culture of its own. Mahabalipuram is a small yet fascinating town in Tamil Nadu which has become one of the top tourist destinations. There are 4 major attractions in mahabalipura</p>
<ul>
<li>Mahabalipuram Shore Temple</li>
<li>Wide Beach</li>
<li>Pancha Ratha</li>
<li>Krishna‚Äôs Butterball</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chennai">Chennai</h3>
<p><img src="/images/tamilnadu/beach.jpg" alt="Beach"></p>
<ul>
<li>Coming to the end of my trip, I have to catch the train from chennai at 12 in the night and i reached to chennai at 7. I was roaming in chennai beach for about 4 hours without any clue. I still remember the night walk in the marina beach with the cool breeze and the waves sound.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-experience">My experience</h3>
<p>Long story short, I enjoyed my own company throught the trip. I faced problems, solved problems, made new friends, enjoyed the views, no disturbances&hellip;</p>
