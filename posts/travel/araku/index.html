Araku Valley is one of the most spectacular vacation spots in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Surrounded by high mountains, lush green forests, foggy clouds, and a pleasing climate, Araku Valley is a perfect escape for those who are tired of living the monotonous life. The serene and tranquil environs not only calm your soul but also make your inner soul happy.</p><h2 id=how-to-reach>How to reach</h2><p>We travelled from Vijayawada. It has a good rail connectivity and therefore, it is a preferable mode of transport for tourist commuting to Visakhapatnam. You can take a direct train from Vijayawada railway station to Vishakapatnam.</p><h2 id=things-we-did-in-vizag>Things we did in Vizag</h2><h2 id=simhachalam>Simhachalam</h2><p>There comes a time in life when we seek peace. And when it is about peace, what can be better than heading to a religious place, right? One of the religious places where you will not only feel peace all around but you can also enjoy a fabulous road trip is Simhachalam temple.</p><p>Simhachalam has one of the eighteen shrines dedicated to Lord Narasimha, a half-man, half-lion incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The idol is in the Tribhanga position and has lion head on top of a powerful human torso.</p><h2 id=fly-to-kailasagiri>Fly to Kailasagiri</h2><p>Kailasa giri is located on a hilltop and is a must to visiting place for all people visiting Vishakhapatnam. It is one of the prominent hill top parks with panoramic sea view on the East Coast.</p><p>Ropeway Ride is an actual route to reach the hilltop other than being a major attraction at the place. The thrilling ride offers mesmerising views of the surroundings and a high adrenaline rush. The cabins offers passengers to enjoy a beautiful bird’s eye view of the forest, valley, and beach.</p><h2 id=night-camp>Night Camp</h2><p>Being very chilled in the weather of Araku, this is the perfect time for a Campfire. This is the thing i never forgot in my life. Staying in 5°C in a tent&mldr;. huffff that excites right ?.</p><h2 id=araku-valley>Araku Valley</h2><p>Araku is a picturesque tribal settlement in the Eastern Ghats, For me, the drive is an end in itself, a mind-blowing experience as one navigates through umpteen hair-pin bends on a steep mountain road which snakes its way up the Eastern Ghats to an altitude of some 1200 metres above sea level.</p><p>This is one of those road trips on which one does not feel like driving fast but prefer to gently cruise along the serpentine path, inhaling the pristine air and feasting on the visual candy being proffered so generously by Mother Nature.</p><h2 id=trek-to-ranajilleda-waterfall>Trek to Ranajilleda Waterfall</h2><p>The trek to the waterfalls is around 30 min. It is a huge adventure that we did to reach the waterfalls.</p><p>This is a beautiful water cascade situated in Ranajilleda. The waterfalls are surrounded by thick forests and contains many huge rock formations. The path of the waterfall is blocked by the rock formations and as a result there are many natural water slides formed. These water slides bless the area with great natural beauty.</p><h2 id=padmapuram-botanical-garden>Padmapuram Botanical Garden</h2><p>The British built this 26 acre spanning garden to supply vegetables and fruits to the British soldiers fighting in World War-II. After the war ended, the garden was converted into Horticultural Nursery where flowers and trees of rare species were grown.</p><p>There are special tree houses built, ten feet above the ground, within this complex meant for overnight stay. These are also known as hanging cottages as they sway when there is a breeze blowing.</p><h2 id=araku-tribal-museum>Araku Tribal Museum</h2><p>Your Araku Valley trip cannot be complete without a visit to this museum. There are more than 19 tribes residing in the neighboring areas and the museum offers an insight into their colorful outfits, culture and way of life.</p><p>Araku Tribal Museum was established in 1996 with the intention of spreading awareness among the tourists about the tribal lifestyle of Eastern Ghats.</p><h2 id=borra-caves>Borra Caves</h2><p>The caverns of Borra spans to a depth of 80 m and is considered the “deepest cave in India”. Borra Caves are well known for irregular formations of stalactites and stalagmites. Some portions of the cave also exhibit varying sizes of speleothems.</p><p>These mineral rich caves are considered to have been formed 50 million years ago! The caves are lit up with colorful lights which eradicate the scary factor associated with usual cave trips!</p><h2 id=coffee-plantations>Coffee plantations</h2><p>Taking its name from Araku Valley, a lush green valley deep in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, the Araku Coffee is cultivated in the valley&rsquo;s protected ecosystem which offers the ideal growing conditions for coffee.</p><p>The weather of the Araku Valley – with its hot days and cold nights along with the iron-rich soil allows the coffee to ripen slowly giving it its aromatic richness and taste.</p><h2 id=ananthagiri-hills>Ananthagiri hills</h2><p>Also known as Godamguda Viewpoint, this is one of the best spots for tourists to visit and witness the scintillating beauty of the hills from a bird’s eye view. Furthermore, trekking or reaching up to the point is not difficult at all. Upon reaching, you can spend quality time together, capture memories against the lush green backdrop of Ananthagiri, and embrace the breezy weather.</p><h2 id=rushikonda-beach>Rushikonda Beach</h2><p>Rushikonda beach is widely known for its golden sands and tidy waves of Bay of Bengal. Surrounded by green plants, Rushikonda beach looks picture perfect attracting nature lovers in huge numbers.</p><p>Known as one of the virgin beaches of South India, Rushikonda beach is no doubt one of the best beaches of Vizag.</p><h2 id=cmr-central>CMR central</h2><p>It is for the shopping, or for the movies, or for the food, or even for hanging out with our friends, CMR Central is the one stop.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://dileepsa.github.io/>&copy; Dileepsa 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
