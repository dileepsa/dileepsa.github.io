Pondicherry is a lively destination that offers everything - colonial architechture, pebbeled beaches, historic sites & heritage, a beautiful seaside prominade, and more</p><h2 id=history-and-culture>History and Culture</h2><p>Nestled on the Eastern coast of India, Pondicherry is one of the seven Union Territories of India. The Union Territory of Puducherry includes four coastal regions namely Puducherry, Yanam, Mahe, and Karaikal. Pondicherry was once the home for the French and they blended South Indian culture with their own unique tradition.</p><p>Therefore, the beautiful French Quarter in Pondicherry gives you a feel of Indian French culture as the portion of France still exists in India. French-style villas, streets, languages, and cuisine are some of the examples with a touch of Dravidian style culture.</p><h2 id=my-experience-in-pondi>My Experience in Pondi</h2><p>Pondicherry was like a dream. A beautiful dream that was full of clean sandy beaches, laid back colourful streets and European architecture.</p><p>I kept asking myself ‚Äòam I in India or France?‚Äô.</p><p>It‚Äôs quite a bizarre feeling seeing all French on street signs, caf√©s and from people‚Äôs mouths here! But, the food was to die for. A perfect taste of home and welcome comfort food.</p><p>It was like it had its own mood, a rhythm. As you walk around the laid back atmosphere is catching.</p><p>The people are so friendly and it‚Äôs far less touristy than Goa in the West. This was one of my favourite places in South India.</p><h2 id=how-to-reach-pondi>How to reach Pondi</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re travelling from Bangalore, train is the best bet to try. The nearest major railway station is Yeswanthpur. The train starts around 8:30 pm from yeswanthpur. The train ride will be 9 hours.</p><p>I would highly recommend pre booking the train tickets as it costs around 400-500 rs for a sleeper.</p><p>We travelled in general for less ticket price and paid our one night sleep.</p><h2 id=where-to-stay-in-pondi>Where to stay in Pondi</h2><p>Pondicherry has a wealth of suitable hotels to stay in, whatever your budget!</p><p>We decided to stay in Valentines Hostel which was a 500 meter walk from the railway station.</p><p>We are 9 people in total. So, we booked a 2-BHK for one night which costs 4500. The Staff of Valentines hostel were friendly. I would highly suggest to stay here.</p><h4 id=rent-bikes-to-roam-around>Rent Bikes to roam around</h4><p>We rented 5 bikes for the second day to roam around pondi. The valentines hostel owner arranged the bikes. The rent is 400 per each bike</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Petrol is ours üòÖ</p><h2 id=things-we-did-in-pondi>Things we did in Pondi</h2><h3 id=explore-french-colony>Explore French Colony</h3><p>French colony is like every photographer‚Äôs dream. The typical Pondicherry scenes were vintage bicycles perched up against vibrant yellow walls with oil lamps.</p><p>All the electric blue street signs will begin with ‚ÄòRue‚Äô and palm trees will sway on nearly every road! It‚Äôs truly a feast for your eyes if you‚Äôve been used to seeing Indian architecture.</p><p>I simply enjoyed just walking around the streets here. Seeing all the effortless beauty of the buildings and the life which was going on around them.</p><h3 id=vist-aurobindo-ashram>Vist Aurobindo Ashram</h3><p>Sri Aurobindo Ashram is a kind of place where you can seek spirituality in a laid-back atmosphere and attain inner peace by meditating in its serene aura. The magical environment of this shrine allows you to forget everything as soon as you step inside the ashram and the beautiful backdrop will leave you awe-struck, thus making the overall setting look even more spectacular.</p><h3 id=take-a-stroll-to-rock-beach>Take a stroll to Rock beach</h3><p>I love being by the sea and when I reached the water‚Äôs edge in Pondicherry, it brought it home just how much I missed the ocean air.</p><p>Although this beach isn‚Äôt as sandy as others in the area, it‚Äôs still a really nice place to visit and stroll along the promenade.</p><h3 id=take-a-day-trip-from-pondicherry-to-auroville>Take a day trip from Pondicherry to Auroville</h3><p>Auroville is an experimental township in India.</p><p>Here, you can visit the ‚Äòsoul of the city‚Äô their famous Matrimandir.</p><p>The orb made of gold is a symbol of spiritual significance to those who practice integral yoga, a philosophy which was practised by Shri Aurobindo and ‚ÄúThe Mother‚Äù here. It took 37 years to build.</p><p>If you‚Äôre only here for a couple of hours, you can obtain a free pass from the visitor centre to walk to the viewing point.</p><p>It can be a little bit of a mystery getting here as it‚Äôs deep in the Pondicherry jungle.</p><p>We took cab from Railway station to Auroville and paid 250 rs for person.</p><h3 id=chill-in-the-winds-of-pondi-beach>Chill in the winds of Pondi beach</h3><p>My favourite place in Pondicherry was Prominade beach also known as Rock beach. It‚Äôs one of the cleanest beaches in the area and the scenes are just perfect.</p><p>You can reach here via an auto, motorbike or taxi and it‚Äôs around 20 minutes away from the Railway station</p><p>The palm trees, colourful guesthouses and cabanas all contribute to making this the perfect place to spend an afternoon.</p><p>The community here are very conscious of making sure this beach remains clean and they‚Äôre doing a pretty good job.</p><p>Littering is a constant struggle in India wherever you go and beaches, even as pretty as this, aren‚Äôt immune to it.</p><p>But at Pondi, there‚Äôs hardly any rubbish and so it‚Äôs just clean sands to enjoy.</p><p>We spent all the afternoon playing here. It was a unique experience than other beaches which i have visited.</p><h3 id=visit-gandhi-thatha>Visit Gandhi thatha</h3><p>Right in the heat of Promenade, there is a magnificent statue of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation. The statue is four-meter high, made up of black stones and surrounded by 8 granite pillars.</p><p>The space in front of the statue is a place where various cultural and musical activities performed throughout the year.</p><p>At Promenade beach, you can see half of the town taking a leisurely walk or spending their evening just be sitting near the beach. The roads of the Promenade get close for vehicles from 5 pm in the evening to early morning making it a perfect place to roam around in the evening freely.</p><p>The place also plays a significant role as it is close to many nearby attractions namely the statue of Joan Arc, the War Memorial, Old Lighthouse, the heritage Town Hall, etc.</p><h3 id=visit-paradise-beach-via-chunnambar-boat-house>Visit Paradise beach Via Chunnambar Boat House</h3><p>Also known as Plage Paradiso, Paradise beaches us locate in Chunnambar. It is an isolated beach and can be reached by taking the ferry across the backwaters which take around 20-30 minutes from Chunnambar boat house located 8 km away from the main city.</p><p>The view of the backwater on the way to the beach is just breathtaking and is surrounded by green and thick mangrove forests. You can also spot a lot of birds on the way to the beach. The sand of the beach is soft & pristine with blue waves of the water. Because of the high current in the water, it is not advisable to go deep.</p><p>At Paradise beach, there are a large number of huts spread across the beach which provide shelter in ran and strong winds. Moreover, they also have a changing room facility where you can change after having fun in the water.</p><p>In addition to that, there are various stalls and shops available offering coconut water, kulfi, and few snacking options. Don‚Äôt expect varieties of food though.</p><p>The beach remains open from 9 am to 5 pm. The entry fee is 150 INR per person with the additional cost of parking, boats, and ferries. The Chunnambar also provides tree houses for overnight stay.</p><h3 id=visit-one-of-the-many-churches-in-pondicherry>Visit one of the many churches in Pondicherry</h3><p>Being a French colony all those years ago, their legacy has left a lot of French culture in Pondicherry.</p><p>Along with the French language, patisseries and signs, they have also left a lot of churches with a European influence.</p><p>They were so colourful and had some glorious architecture inside.</p><h3 id=nightlife-in-pondi>Nightlife in Pondi</h3><p>Pondicherry is another beautiful indian city that lights up under a sky full of stars.</p><ul><li><p>Pondicherry is a paradise for food lovers. You will find a variety of restaurants, cafes, and bars in Pondicherry offering authentic cuisine.</p></li><li><p>Pondicherry is a great place for street shopping. We ended up buying a lot of things without spending too much.</p></li><li><p>Heritage town of Pondicherry is a famous and well maintained place which represents the ancient French beauty of architecture. This place has many bars and pubs with a French touch and this place has a scenic beauty which makes one feel that he or she is standing or roaming in any of the famous French cities.</p></li><li><p>Rocky Beach adds on to the treasure of nightlife in Pondicherry. It is said that if one does not visit beaches of Pondicherry at night for a walk then his or her experience of nightlife in Pondicherry is incomplete.</p></li></ul><h3 id=other-activities-to-enjoy>Other activities to enjoy</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Surfing:</strong> Lately, Pondicherry has become one of the top places for surfing.
